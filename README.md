HTML: A simple page with an image and two buttons labeled "Agrandir" (Enlarge) and "RÃ©duire" (Reduce).

The image can be resized by clicking these buttons.

The page shows a welcome alert on load.

The image also has mouseover and mouseout events ready for custom behaviors (though currently empty).

The CSS centers the content and styles buttons for spacing and width.

JavaScript functions handle resizing and the welcome alert.
